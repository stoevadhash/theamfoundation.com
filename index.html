            The AM Foundation is founded by Adriana Taseva and Martin Stoev to support extraordinary talent in the arts and sciences. It seeks maximum impact and prefers to lead rather than to follow.
            To that purpose, our first initiative is to develop, organise, and scale the Carl Gauss Competition in Physics preparing the brightest high-school students for the International Physics Olympiad.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>The first edition will be held in April 2023 in Sofia, Bulgaria.</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            Our thesis is that by applying laser-sharp focus on preparation we can achieve much better performance at the actual olympiad, therefore leading to better educational opportunities for the students involved. If this experiment proves to be successful, we will extend it to additional fields.
            We will keep numerical records of past and future performance of the teams to quantify the impact we deliver.
